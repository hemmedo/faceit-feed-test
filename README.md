* Typescript, React Navigation, Apisauce, Redux, React-Query, Fast-Image

- Project satisfies all requirements that are asked for in the assignment document.
- Redux seemed to be forced for this kind of basic assignment but I still implemented a usage for it.
- Don't forget to install packages via yarn or npm before trying to run the project. Also for ios, do "pod install".
